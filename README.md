# Docker Real-World Labs - Production Issues & Fixes

This repository contains **20+ real-world Docker labs** based on **actual problems clients face in production**.

These labs demonstrate my hands-on ability to:
- Deploy Dockerized applications
- Fix broken Docker environments
- Debug container failures
- Optimize Docker images and builds for production use

This is **not theory**.  
Every lab starts with a real problem and ends with a working, validated solution.

## What This Repository Proves

- I can debug Docker issues under pressure
- I understand production-grade Docker workflows
- I optimize for performance, stability, and cost
- I work the way real DevOps/Docker engineers do

If your app:
- works locally but fails in Docker
- has slow or broken Docker builds
- crashes, restarts, or won’t deploy
- uses bloated or insecure images

I’ve likely fixed that exact issue here.
