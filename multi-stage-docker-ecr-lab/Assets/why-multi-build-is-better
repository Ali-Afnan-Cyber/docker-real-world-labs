Why Multi-Stage Docker Builds Are Better

Smaller Image Size
 Only the final app files are included.
 No extra build tools or temp files.

Better Security
 Less stuff means fewer security risks.
 No compilers or package managers in the final image.

Faster CI/CD
 Smaller images upload and download faster.
 Speeds up deployments and builds.
